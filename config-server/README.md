# Config server

- Configuration Management simply means managing and controlling the configurations of each microservice in the system.
- Configurations may include details such as database connections, external service URLs, caching settings, etc.
- As the number of microservices grows, managing configurations becomes a challenge.
- A centralized Config Server provides a central place for managing configurations across all microservices.
